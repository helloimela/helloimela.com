We use Headless CMS which is built with Strapi and fetch the data with GraphQL query. The concept behind the website architechture is that we want to have versioning over the content. So the content of the website is served on the build stage and versioned in Github pull request.","On this project, I was involved in the creation of the website and the CMS for the content. We developed a custom dashboard interface in Strapi to add a little touch of Scania looks and feel to the default dashboard. The development of the dashboard in Strapi is using React and JSX. I also deployed the CMS to our organisation cloud service which is served in AWS. On this task, I implemented the concept of deploying application in cloud architechture, from the database and also the application container on the internal network. I created quite a few NodeJS script to support this application running on the container. I also created a script for the uploading process with AWS SDK for Javascript.","For the website itself, I involved in the daily maintenance of the website and creating Angular components. I worked a lot with my fellow developer in the team where we review each other\'s pull request, and also planning the whole architecture together. We also have a lot of communications with the designer and product owner, in order to understand each requirements of the website. On this project, I also worked a lot with GraphQL query, to fetch the correct output and also sometimes we need to update a bulk of data in a faster way."],"gh":"https://github.com/scania-digital-design-system/sdds-website","link":["https://digitaldesign.scania.com/"],"image":"./assets/scania.png","keywords":"NodeJS, Angular 8, Typescript, Headless CMS, Strapi, GraphQL, React, JSX"},{"id":2,"title":"Scania Digital Design System components and theme","objective":"We deliver web components and theme to help developers in Scania implement Scania styles in a more efficient way.

The main challenge is that we need to think about framework agnostic solution since every developers in Scania have different framework to work with. We decided to create a collection of web components since it will work in most of modern browsers and can be used even with simple HTML application.","We used StencilJS and SCSS as our main stacks for the project. StencilJS is based on Typescrypt and using JSX syntax, make it pretty convenience to use. The theme is delivered via a web component called sdds-theme. And from this component, developers are able to fetch the styling of all components. The theme contains all the CSS Variable for all the design tokens. The CSS Variable then can be used to style both StencilJS web components and Scania CSS classes.","We published all the packages in NPM and using Lerna to handle the monorepo structure of the project.

On my work, I mostly work with Angular, Typescript, and pure JS, and also React but only when testing my team\'s product and customizing Strapi dashboard UI. That is why I created this project.

The platform and the game is used as a promotional tool, and many people loves it. So I created this application, which will generate a bingo game based on the input from the JSON file. On the final stage, people can share the result by making a screenshot and post it in their social media. I have used it to create a custom bingo on my friend\'s birthday to surprise him and see how many people can connect their memories with him. It was so much fun and many of his friends who is not reaching him out for a while, get connected with him through a game. However, there are a lot of things to improve. For example, the UI for the final result screen can be better. Aother thing is that we need to clone the project and change the data in the JSON manually to make it work.
